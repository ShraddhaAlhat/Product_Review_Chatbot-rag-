Is it because it is expensive or what is the reason i really can't understand. It is a beast!! Works like a phone and a tablet and fits into a pocket which is awesome. Blazing speed with 12 gb ram and you can expand the ram virtually by compromising on the memory. It's a masterpiece of a phone. The fold is very sturdy. You have to get used to the multiple screens. The camera with 50 mp is awesome. It is a new sensor, so comparing 108 mp pictures...
