Display is awesome. Light and easy to carry thanks to the bridge at the bottom. But this is not a good travel companion (given the large size). For the cost... does not give a premium feel. My previous Zenbook felt classier. Keyboard backlight is almost useless. A simple white light would have been so much better. VPN services currently does not support ARM architec...

If u use the energy saver mode and watch some videos then it will give around 5 Hour battery life.  And remember only on video playback.

This particular mouse however is not up to the mark. If you're watching a video where the mouse is inactive for a while, it will stop working (goes into sleep mode) until you click the button. Clicking on a running video pauses it and there is no way you can hover the mouse to just see the progress bar. You cannot wake up the computer from sleep or have the s...
